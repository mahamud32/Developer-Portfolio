                A web developer is a programmer responsible for turning user stories, mockups, and web designs into
                functional websites. They use web fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build, manage, and
                deploy web applications.

                An aspiring web developer must first complete an education to develop basic coding and programming
                skills. In most cases, this is a computer science degree program with core courses in systems design,
                data management, and the essential programming languages used by industry professionals.
